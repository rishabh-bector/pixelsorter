# Pixel Sorter

This program implements several variations of the original pixel sorting algorithm in Rust. It also provides an easy way to chain various pixel sorts together and execute them sequentially.

### What is pixel sorting?

From [this website](http://satyarth.me/articles/pixel-sorting/):
>Pixel sorting is an interesting, glitchy effect which selectively orders the pixels in the rows/columns of an image. It was popularized (possibly invented) by artist Kim Asendorf.

Here are some examples of what pixel sorting can produce (all created with this program):
